The main function contains an Ubuntu command to compile the program in Ubuntu 
for Ubuntu and for Windows. Like any from-Ubuntu for-Windows compilation, we use 
the g++-mingw-w64 tool. Instead of ncurses, we use PDCurses, which can be cloned 
from here: 

https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses

I renamed "PDCurses-master" into "PDCurses". 

$ cd PDCurses
$ make -f Makefile CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc 

This produces the static library "pdcurses.a", which the linker can then be pointed to. 

x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++-posix /* source files */ -I./PDCurses -L./PDCurses/wincon -l:pdcurses.a -o /* output filename */ -static

-I tells the linker where to find "curses.h", and -L tells the linker where to 
find "pdcurses.a". -static includes all libraries within the executable, so that 
it can be ran independent of g++ being installed on the end-user's system.
